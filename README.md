# MBTA North/South Station Departure Schedule 
This is a web app built using Ruby and Sinatra to parse an input CSV file and display train departure times for North/South Station.

##How to Set Up
Simply clone the repo, install the required gems listed by the Gemfile, and start up the server. It will parse the "departures.csv" by default and display its data, but it is set to work with any data with the underlying schema.
